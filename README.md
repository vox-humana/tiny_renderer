### Taking [Tiny Renderer course](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) in Rust

- This is my very first experience with Rust. Thus, you can't learn anything from this repo apart from all mistakes I've made.
- Trying to limit number of dependencies and invent my own bicycles for the sake of learning.
- However, for more fun use [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid.git) as UI framework for a tiny demo app.

Console app that generates tga images:
```shell
cargo run --bin images
```

### Some Rust WTFs
> impl for type defined outside of crate.

Can't implement protocol outside the type crate. Seems like the only workaround is to add an extra wrapper type.

Runtime panic for overflow. Unlike Swift, where `Int` is the default type for computation or even indexing, Rust forces you to select exact integer type.
```rust
let x: u16 = ...
let y: u16 = ...
y - x // panic, maybe
```
Also, it doesn't give you `abs` for unsigned https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2914.
So I decided to use `i32` for calculation in Bresenhamâ€™s Line Drawing Algorithm and then force cast :facepalm: back to `u16`.

Structs file serialization requires unsafe.
Maybe, I am missing something but this is super verbose and potential source of errors:
```rust
unsafe {
    let p_data: * const u8 = mem::transmute( & self.pixels[0]);
    let data = slice::from_raw_parts(
        p_data, mem::size_of::< RGBColor > () * self.pixels.len(),
    );
}
```
---
Compiler knows array size, however, it doesn't know that it is not empty: 
```rust
let non_empty_array: [V; 2] = ...
let optional_value: Option<&V> = non_empty_array.first();
```

There is **no** built-in pseudo random function
https://github.com/rust-random/getrandom/issues/21
---
No functions overloading
---
No built-in numeric trait
