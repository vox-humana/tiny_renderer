Taking [Tiny Renderer course](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) in Rust

For more fun use [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid.git) as UI framework for a tiny demo app.  

### Some Rust WTFs
`impl for type defined outside of crate.`
Can't implement protocol outside the type crate. Seems like the only workaround is to add an extra wrapper type.

Runtime panic for overflow. Unlike Swift, where `Int` is the default type for computation or even indexing, Rust forces you to select exact integer type.
```rust
let x: u16 =...
let y: u16 =...
y - x // panic, maybe
```
Also, it doesn't give you `abs` for unsigned https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2914.
So I decided to use `i32` for calculation in Bresenhamâ€™s Line Drawing Algorithm and then force cast :facepalm: back to `u16`.

Structs file serialization requires unsafe.
Maybe, I am missing something but this is super verbose and potential source of errors:
```rust
unsafe {
    let p_data: * const u8 = mem::transmute( & self.pixels[0]);
    let data = slice::from_raw_parts(
        p_data, mem::size_of::< RGBColor > () * self.pixels.len(),
    );
}
```
